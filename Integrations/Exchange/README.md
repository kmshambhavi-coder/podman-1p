# Exchange

Integration provides support for Microsoft Exchange 2010 - 2019 and Microsoft Office365 mail servers. Integration uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) for communication. Integration includes a series of actions to send out emails and work with received emails, along with a connector to monitor specific mailboxes and ingest emails from that mailboxes as alerts to Google SecOps for further analysis.

## Jobs

#### Oauth Token Expiry Notification Job
Note that the job is deprecated and will be removed in the next 6 months. Oauth Token Expiry Notification Job is recommended to use if integration is working with Oauth refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are valid only for 90 days, after that User will need to create a new refresh token to use in the integration. This job will send reminder emails to the configured recipient list when the token will expire in 10, 5 and 1 day. Once a new token is set in this job, the notification timer will start over.

|Client Secret|False|Password|*****|
|Tenant (Directory) ID|True|String||
|Refresh Token|True|Password|*****|

#### Token Renewal Job
Token renewal job should be used to periodically update the refresh token configured for the integration. By default, the refresh token expires every 90 days, making integration unusable upon expiration. It is recommended to run this job every 7 or 14 days to make sure that refresh token will be up to date.
