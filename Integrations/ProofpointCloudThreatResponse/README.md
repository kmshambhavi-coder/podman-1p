# ProofpointCloudThreatResponse

Proofpoint Threat Response includes a cloud-based security solution that runs in Proofpoint's cloud infrastructure as part of Threat Response's suite of products. It acts on email messages with identified malicious URLs, attachments and BEC (Business Email Compromise) threats. Threat Response removes such emails from the user's mailboxes, and subsequently from any mailboxes to which they were forwarded.
