These files are executed in a user's context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly.\n\n<code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells and <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> script is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell is opened, the <code>~/.bashrc</code> script is executed. This allows users more fine-grained control over when they want certain commands executed. These shell scripts are meant to be written to by the local user to configure their own environment.\n\nThe macOS Terminal.app is a little different in that it runs a login shell by default each time a new terminal window is opened, thus calling <code>~/.bash_profile</code> each time instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.\n\nAdversaries may abuse these shell scripts by inserting arbitrary shell commands that may be used to execute other binaries to gain persistence. Every time the user logs in or opens a new shell, the modified ~/.bash_profile and/or ~/.bashrc scripts will be executed.(Citation: amnesia malware)","created":"2020-01-24T14:13:45.936Z","x_mitre_data_sources":["Process use of network","Process command-line parameters","Process monitoring","File monitoring"],"x_mitre_is_subtechnique":true,"x_mitre_permissions_required":["User","Administrator"],"kill_chain_phases":[{"phase_name":"privilege-escalation","kill_chain_name":"mitre-attack"},{"phase_name":"persistence","kill_chain_name":"mitre-attack"}],"modified":"2020-03-24T16:28:04.990Z","name":".bash_profile and .bashrc","x_mitre_platforms":["Linux","macOS"],"object_marking_refs":["marking-definition--fa42a846-8d90-4e51-bc29-71xxxxxxxxxx"],"x_mitre_version":"1.0","type":"attack-pattern","id":"attack-pattern--b63a34e8-0a61-4c97-a23b-bfxxxxxxxxxx","external_references":[{"url":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/Txxxx/xxx","external_id":"Txxxx.xxx","source_name":"mitre-attack"},{"url":"https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-new-iotlinux-malware-targets-dvrs-forms-botnet/","source_name":"amnesia malware","description":"Claud Xiao, Cong Zheng, Yanhui Jia.
